## 💾 Data & Privacy

All data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. It **never leaves your device** — there's no server, no database, no analytics. To move your data to another browser or device, use the **CSV export** button and re-import manually.

Storage behavior notes:
- Sample rows are seeded only on first run.
- If saved data is missing later, the app does not silently reseed over your history.
- If storage is corrupted or blocked, the app shows an error so you know data could not be loaded/saved.
- Export CSV periodically as a backup, especially before clearing browser data or switching profiles.

## 🛠 Customization Tips

- **Add more status options**: Edit the `<select id="fResponse">` in `index.html` and add corresponding badge/row classes in `styles.css`
- **Change the color theme**: All colors are CSS variables at the top of `styles.css` under `:root`
- **Remove sample data**: In `app.js`, clear out the `SAMPLE_DATA` array
- **Add more columns**: Add a `<th>` in `index.html`, a `td` in the `rowHTML()` function in `app.js`, and a matching field in the form
